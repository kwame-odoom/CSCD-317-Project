#CSCD 317 Project

This project demonstrates how an object is closer to the sensor. The sensor determines the range of the closeness of the object and depending on the range, the led either turns on to be green, blue or red. If the distance is between 0-25cm, the light is red and the buzzer beeps constantly. If the distance is between 26-40cm, the light is blue and the buzzer beeps at an interval of 1secs(it turns on and off at 1 second interval). If the distance is greater than 40cm, the light is green and there is no beep. The distance a all times is recorded on the 4 digit 7 segment display except when the led is green
